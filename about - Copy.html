<blockquote> 
  <q>Don't let the expectations and opinions of other people affect your decisions. It's your life, not theirs. 
    Do what matters most to you; do what makes you feel alive and happy. Don't let the expectations and ideas of others
     limit who you are. If you let others tell you who you are, you are living their reality — not yours. There is more 
     to life than pleasing people. There is much more to life than following others' prescribed path. There is so much more
      to life than what you experience right now. You need to decide who you are for yourself. Become a whole being. Adventure.”

              <p>My name is Aaliyah Labossiere and I am a mixed media artist who works with collages, painting, and assemblage. I create layered and textured artworks that combine different materials and techniques, such as paper, fabric, wood, metal, paint, glue, and stitching. My work is inspired by my personal history, my cultural identity, and my social and political views. <p>
              <p>I was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia, where I developed a love for art and creativity at an early age. I have learned from many influential mentors. I am currently working on a new project that explores the concept of memory and trauma through the use of found objects and personal artifacts. <p>
              <p>I believe that mixed media art is a powerful and expressive form of communication, as it allows me to experiment with different forms and meanings, and to challenge the conventions and expectations of traditional art. I hope that my work can provoke curiosity, emotion, and reflection among the viewers, and contribute to the diversity and richness of contemporary art and culture. <p>
              <p>A painter who works with acrylics and oils. I create abstract and expressive paintings that reflect my emotions and experiences. My work focuses on the themes of color, movement, and energy, as I explore the possibilities of painting as a visual language. <p>
              <p>I create my work using a combination of brushes, palette knives, and dripping techniques. I work on large canvases, often on the floor, to create dynamic and spontaneous compositions. I experiment with different colors, textures, and layers, to create depth and contrast in my paintings. I aim to create a visual impact that engages the viewers and invites them to feel the emotions and sensations that I express. <p>
              <p>My work is a form of self-expression and a way of exploring my own identity and reality. I hope that my work can inspire curiosity, wonder, and dialogue among the viewers, and contribute to the advancement of painting and art. </p>
